LUCKY DUCK CASINO CLASS ACTIVITY


We did an activity in class, where Lucky Duck Casinos thought that players and dealers were cheating in some of the games.

Enclosed are the scripts used to navigate/pull the needed data as well as my findings on the correlation of outages on specific dealers and players.
